I would like to propose a translation in the following language:

- (your language)

This language is used in the following countries:

- (your country)
- (countries that use the language...)


<hr>

Please follow the [Translation Guidelines](https://github.com/Lrakotoson/Covid-19/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#implement-translation):

- Fork the repository, Create new branch
- make a copy of the `translation_blank.csv` file and replace `blank` with the 2-letter code of the language. (Eg: `fr` for french).  
Then, open the file in your favorite editor, add to the first line the 2-letter language code and translate in the second column without modifying the first one.
